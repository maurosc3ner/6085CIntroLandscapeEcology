["week8.html", "Chapter 7 Landscape analysis in R 7.1 Using metric functions 7.2 Lab Practice", " Chapter 7 Landscape analysis in R Landscape metrics is an R package for calculating landscape metrics for categorical landscape patterns in a tidy workflow. The package can be used as a drop-in replacement for FRAGSTATS, as it offers a reproducible workflow for landscape analysis in a single environment. It also allows for calculations of four theoretical metrics of landscape complexity: + Overall spatio-thematic complexity, + Thematic complexity, + Configurational complexity, + Disambiguator of pattern types having the same overall complexity (Nowosad and Stepinski 2018). Landscape metrics supports raster spatial objects and takes RasterLayer, RasterStacks, RasterBricks or lists of RasterLayer as input arguments. Every function can be used in a piped workflow, as it always takes the data as the first argument and returns a tibble Firstly install the proper libraries to handle raster data in R. You can achieve this by typing into the R Studio console or using the Install Packages menu (Tools-&gt;Install Packages…) install.packages(&quot;landscapemetrics&quot;) install.packages(&quot;landscapetools&quot;) The resolution of a raster cell has to be in meters, as the package converts units internally and returns results in either meters, square meters or hectares. Before using landscapemetrics, be sure to check your raster (see check_raster()). All functions in landscapemetrics start with lsm_ (for landscapemetrics). The second part of the name specifies the level (patch - p, class - c or landscape - l). The last part of the function name is the abbreviation of the corresponding metric (e.g. ennfor the euclidean nearest-neighbor distance): 7.1 Using metric functions Every function follows the same implementation design, so the usage is quite straightforward: library(landscapemetrics) library(landscapetools) data(&quot;landscape&quot;) # landscape raster #show_landscape(landscape) Save your raster using the writeRaster functionality of past lab session: library(raster) ## Loading required package: sp library(rgdal) ## rgdal: version: 1.3-6, (SVN revision 773) ## Geospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded ## Loaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 2.2.3, released 2017/11/20 ## Path to GDAL shared files: /usr/share/gdal/2.2 ## GDAL binary built with GEOS: TRUE ## Loaded PROJ.4 runtime: Rel. 4.9.3, 15 August 2016, [PJ_VERSION: 493] ## Path to PROJ.4 shared files: (autodetected) ## Linking to sp version: 1.3-1 rf &lt;- writeRaster(landscape, filename=&quot;myRaster.tif&quot;, overwrite=TRUE) 7.2 Lab Practice Load lab11_assignment.tif in fragstats el1 &lt;- raster(&quot;lab11_assignment.tif&quot;) #show_landscape(el1) Let’s estimate the following metrics: + Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance by patch + Total edge by class + Total area by landscape level byPatch&lt;-lsm_p_enn(el1, directions = 8, verbose = TRUE) byPatch ## # A tibble: 99 x 6 ## layer level class id metric value ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 patch 1 1 enn 2500 ## 2 1 patch 1 2 enn 901. ## 3 1 patch 1 3 enn 901. ## 4 1 patch 1 4 enn 500 ## 5 1 patch 1 5 enn 559. ## 6 1 patch 1 6 enn 500 ## 7 1 patch 1 7 enn 17799. ## 8 1 patch 1 8 enn 20555. ## 9 1 patch 2 9 enn 9500 ## 10 1 patch 2 10 enn 3335. ## # … with 89 more rows lsm_l_ta(el1) ## # A tibble: 1 x 6 ## layer level class id metric value ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 landscape NA NA ta 62500 lsm_c_te(el1) ## # A tibble: 10 x 6 ## layer level class id metric value ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 class 1 NA te 37000 ## 2 1 class 2 NA te 21250 ## 3 1 class 12 NA te 319750 ## 4 1 class 13 NA te 2000 ## 5 1 class 15 NA te 93000 ## 6 1 class 16 NA te 24250 ## 7 1 class 24 NA te 312250 ## 8 1 class 27 NA te 21500 ## 9 1 class 28 NA te 464250 ## 10 1 class 31 NA te 121250 If you want to calculate all the stats you can type: fullStats&lt;-calculate_lsm(el1, level = &quot;patch&quot;) # Show only the first 10 patch stats head(fullStats) ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## layer level class id metric value ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 patch 1 1 area 106. ## 2 1 patch 1 2 area 100 ## 3 1 patch 1 3 area 25 ## 4 1 patch 1 4 area 188. ## 5 1 patch 1 5 area 6.25 ## 6 1 patch 1 6 area 37.5 How many stats did you get using calculate_lsm?

Any typo error can cause this issue. I am getting errors Sometimes R packages gives you different execution errors. Our advice is to install the last R software (3.5.3) and R Studio in order to get latest functionalities and bug fixes. Also this lab has been tested entirely in the 415 lab computers. You can also take the most of that facility. It is too slow These are complex calculations, be patient :) "],

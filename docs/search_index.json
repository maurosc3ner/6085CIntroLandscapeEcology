Cuadros Office: 401 C Braunstein Hall, Main Campus Email: diego.cuadros@uc.edu Introduction of the TAs Andres Hernandez-Camacho M.Sc. https://github.com/andher1802 Esteban Correa-Agudelo M.Sc. https://github.com/maurosc3ner Format of the Lab sessions: This is not a class on statistics !!!! Only a brief introduction about the use of the tool for a better understanding of the landscape ecology applications. Notebooks with theory, practices, code samples, etc. Videos with detailed explanation about the topics. Lab assignment weekly starting on week 2. Lab sessions tutorials and materials can be found on https://maurosc3ner.github.io/6085cintrolandscapeecology/. Content The goal of this section is to exemplify the role of R in analysis of spatial data in landscape ecology applications. At the beginning, we will review the fundamentals of the use of R within the RStudio interface, basic data structures and operations. Then, we will explore the capabilities of plotting information with R, and finally the use of the library leaflet integrated with RStudio for visualizing spatial data. This brief introduction will help us in understanding the second part of the course, when we will analyze landscape ecology problems and using advance scripts to compute and simulate interesting scenarios of landscape disturbances. Schedule Table .: Lab schedule for the course (changes can take place due to unexpected events) x Week 1 - No assignment Introduction to R programming language – Getting familiar with R Studio interface, types of data structures, basic operations. Week 2 - Lab assignment 2 Introduction to R programming language - Loops, functions and graphics in R. Week 3 – Lab assignment 3 Introduction to R programming language – Basic statistical operations in R. Proportion test and two sample test, linear regression, and logistic regression.

Create your own dataset with the top 10 largest cities in Ohio. Remember to include for each city: City name lat and long coordinates Income Population The expected answer should be a CSV file Load your Ohio dataset into the leaflet map and show the city as pop up message. Add the proper circles and legends. (Bonus point) 6.4.2 Useful links https://mockaroo.com/ https://www.latlong.net/ https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/ "]
